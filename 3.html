<h2>Java Script란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>avaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled
and multi-paradigm.<br>
It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation
and first-class functions.</p>
<p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core
technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites
use it client-side for web page behavior, often
incorporating third-party libraries.All major web browsers
have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on
the user's device.</p>
<p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports
event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
styles. It has application programming interfaces(APIs)
for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
standard data structures, and the Document Object
Model(DOM).</p>
<p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any
input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or
other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>
<p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web
browsers, but they are now core components of other
software systems, most notably servers and a variety of
applications. <br>
The most popular runtime system for this usage is
Node.js.<br>
Although there are similarities between JavaScript and J
ava, including language name, syntax, and respective
standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and
differ greatly in design. </p>
